The wasp project is a software framework for unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs). 
Although primarily developed for use on quadrotor helicopters the framework has
also been used on fixed wing UAVs and rockets. 

The main components of the system are
 * Modular onboard software architecture
 * Powerful cross-platform groundstation software
 * Open hardware designs
