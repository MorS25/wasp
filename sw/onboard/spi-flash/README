This code can be used to interact with AT26df321 flash memory from an LPC2148
Existing code was modifiewd to create these drivers.
Not guaranteed to be bug free.

Sample code for the spi_flash sourced from:
	http://svn.assembla.com/svn/clock_radio/
	this is for a sam7, but I used the flash driver from here
	
The spi-driver sample code is from:
	http://svn.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/paparazzi3/trunk/sw/airborne/arm7/lpcusb/examples/?root=paparazzi
	this uses SPI0 to drive an SD card
