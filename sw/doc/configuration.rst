Configuration
=============

Configuration occurs in two places, ``config.h`` and ``settings.xml``. The former is
where all architecture specific settings should be placed, typically those settings
very close to the hardware, etc. The latter, ``settings.xml`` is designed to hold
settings which are not machine specific, but feature or configuration specific.
