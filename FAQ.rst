Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Q: Can I buy one of these?**
    No

**Q: Should I use wasp?**
    Probbably not. I suggest you use either `paparazzi <http://paparazzi.enac.fr>`_ or `pixhawk <http://pixhawk.ethz.ch>`_
    instead. Those projects are better supported, and in many ways more capable than wasp.

    If you are looking for an easy, cheap, capable hobbyist/research quadrotor, use `Mikrokopter <http://mikrokopter.de/>`_.
    If you are looking for a professional or advanced research quadrotor, use an `asctec <http://www.asctec.de>`_.

**Q: Why did you create wasp?**
    That is a moderately long story. I needed something that I understood
    top-to-bottom for my PhD. At that time (2008), `paparazzi <http://paparazzi.enac.fr>`_ was the
    best-in-class, and I was fortunate to help design and build the first booz2 quadrotors. When I
    returned from France, I needed a slower moving target to base my PhD work on, so I forked
    the paparazzi code and continued to work on it.

    In 2009/10 I worked on the early pixhawk system at ETH. The original onboard code was an
    amalgamation of wasp and paparazzi, the comms protocol design was from wasp. Once I returned from
    ETH I could no-longer access pixhawk hardware so persisted in using wasp. In the recent years
    pixhawk has advanced tremendously in capability; the comms protocol has become more standardised
    (and is now known as mavlink).

    Pixhawk is a great project with a focus on visual control. It is well supported at ETH,
    both financially and enthusiastically. This is more support than I could ever muster at
    University of Canterbury, and one of the golden rules of open-source software is to go to
    the active and supported project!
